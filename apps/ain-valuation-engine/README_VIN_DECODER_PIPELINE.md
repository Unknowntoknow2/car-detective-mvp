# VIN Decoder Pipeline Integration (FAANG-Level)

## Overview
This script (`vin_decoder_pipeline_integration.py`) runs the production-grade Python VIN decoder abstraction, persists the output to `db_output.json`, and is ready for downstream enrichment and valuation pipelines.

---

## Usage
```bash
python vin_decoder_pipeline_integration.py <VIN>
```
- Decoded, enriched, and compliance-logged output is saved to `db_output.json`.
- Output is ready for ingestion by JS/TS enrichment/valuation modules or any downstream system.

---

## Integration
- Schedule this script in Airflow/Temporal or CI/CD for continuous ingestion.
- `db_output.json` can be read by Node.js, TypeScript, or Python enrichment/valuation engines.
- All provenance, enrichment, and compliance fields are included for full auditability.

---

## Extending
- To add new enrichment or output fields, update `vin_decoder_abstraction.py`.
- For new output targets (DB, queue, API), extend `persist_to_db_output()`.

---

## Example Output
```json
{
  "VIN": "4T1C11AK3PU162087",
  "Make": "TOYOTA",
  ...,
  "provenance": [...],
  "compliance_log": [...],
  "recalls": [...],
  "geo": {...},
  "fuel": {...},
  "explainability": {...}
}
```

## FAANG-Level Best Practices
- Modular, testable, and ready for continuous deployment
- All compliance, provenance, and enrichment fields included
- Fully auditable and extensible for future requirements

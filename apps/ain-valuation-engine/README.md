# AIN Car Valuation Engine

## Overview

AIN (Automotive Intelligence Network) is an enterprise-grade, AI-powered vehicle valuation engine designed to outperform legacy platforms like Kelley Blue Book (KBB), Edmunds, and even modern LLM-based solutions. AIN combines scalable data ingestion, advanced neural architectures, rigorous explainability, robust API services, and operational excellence. It is built for transparency, accuracy, and adaptabilityâ€”empowering buyers, sellers, and business partners with actionable, trustworthy insights.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Vehicle Valuation:**
  Predict fair market values using modern ML and deep learning models.
- **Scalable Data Ingestion:**
  Automated pipelines for ingesting millions of records from diverse sources (Kaggle, EPA, NHTSA, CarAPI, and more).
- **Neural Network Support:**
  Modular pipeline for swapping tree-based (sklearn) and neural (PyTorch/TensorFlow) models.
- **Explainability:**
  SHAP for feature-level breakdowns; GPT-powered human-readable narratives for every valuation.
- **Buyer/Seller Mode:**
  Toggle to generate valuations optimized for buyers or sellers.
- **REST API (Flask/FastAPI):**
  Secure endpoints, input validation, PDF/CSV/JSON export, and robust error handling.
- **Retraining & Model Versioning:**
  CLI and automated retraining workflows with model registry, versioning, and audit trails.
- **Compliance & Security:**
  GDPR/CCPA compliant, PII redaction, authentication/authorization, audit logs.
- **Monitoring & MLOps:**
  MLFlow, Weights & Biases, Evidently, Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry.
- **Documentation & Extensibility:**
  Comprehensive API docs, setup guides, modular codebase for rapid feature expansion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)
- Node.js (for frontend/dashboard, optional)
- API keys for OpenAI GPT (for narrative generation)
- Access to Kaggle, EPA, NHTSA, CarAPI, or other vehicle datasets

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ain-car-valuation.git
cd ain-car-valuation
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
API_AUTH_SECRET=your_api_secret
# Commercial VIN provider (optional)
VINAUDIT_API_KEY=your_vinaudit_key
VINAUDIT_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.vinaudit.com/v2/vehicle  # optional
VINAUDIT_API_TIMEOUT=10  # optional
VINAUDIT_API_MAX_RETRIES=2  # optional
```

If using a commercial provider, set the relevant environment variables as above. The pipeline will automatically use NHTSA first, then fall back to the commercial provider if needed. See `README_VIN_DECODER_PIPELINE.md` for full details.

### Run the API

```bash
python api/app.py
```
Or use Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### CLI Usage

For command-line valuation:

```bash
python main.py --input '{"year": 2020, "make": "Toyota", "model": "Camry", ...}'
```
For retraining:

```bash
python val_engine/train.py --csv path/to/data.csv
```

## API Reference

### POST /valuation

Submit vehicle data and receive a predicted price, SHAP breakdown, and valuation narrative.

**Sample Request:**

```json
{
  "year": 2020,
  "make": "Toyota",
  "model": "Camry",
  "mileage": 45000,
  "condition": "Good",
  "location": "CA",
  "valuation_mode": "seller"
}
```

**Sample Response:**

```json
{
  "predicted_price": 19200,
  "shap": {"mileage": -1200, "condition": +500},
  "narrative": "This valuation is based on recent market listings, adjusted for mileage and conditionâ€¦"
}
```

### Additional Endpoints

- **/retrain:** Trigger model retraining with new CSV data (admin only).
- **/logs/user/{user_id}:** Retrieve audit logs for a user.
- **/export:** Download valuation results in CSV or PDF.

Full OpenAPI documentation is available at `/docs` (when the server is running).

## Data Sources

AIN leverages diverse, free, and public datasets:

- [Kaggle Vehicle Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [EPA Fuel Economy Data](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml)
- [NHTSA vPIC API](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/)
- [CarAPI.app](https://carapi.app/)
- Community datasets on GitHub

Data is versioned (DVC, LakeFS) and enriched (e.g., VIN decoding, EPA specs) for robust, real-world accuracy.

---

## Compliance & Security

- **Authentication:** JWT/OAuth, API keys, SSO (Authelia)
- **PII Redaction & Encryption:** AES-256 at rest, TLS in transit
- **Audit Trails:** Logs all predictions, retraining, API calls
- **GDPR/CCPA:** User data access/deletion, privacy policies

---

## Architecture

The AIN Valuation Engine follows a modern, scalable architecture designed for enterprise deployment:

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript and Vite build system
- **Backend**: Supabase with PostgreSQL database and Edge Functions

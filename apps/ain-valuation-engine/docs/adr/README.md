# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the AIN Valuation Engine project. ADRs help us track important architectural decisions, their context, and their consequences.

3. **Decision**: Update status to "Accepted" or "Rejected"
4. **Implementation**: Update status to "Implemented" when complete
5. **Superseded**: Mark as "Superseded" if replaced by a newer ADR

# Phase 3 & 4: User Experience, Analytics, and Compliance

## Analytics & Reporting
- Run `analytics_report.py` to generate a summary of decode rates and field completeness.
- Review `monitoring.log` for ongoing QA and enrichment coverage.

## User Experience
- CLI flows provide actionable feedback for missing/incomplete fields.
- All user-supplied enrichment is flagged and logged.

## Compliance & Security
- No sensitive data is stored in logs.
- All user-supplied data is handled securely and flagged as user-reported.
- All free/public data sources and limitations are documented.

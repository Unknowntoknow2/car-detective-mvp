# Best Practices – AIN Valuation Engine

## 1. Coding Standards
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.
- Enforce consistent code style via **Prettier** and **ESLint**.
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions for variables, functions, and components.
- Write modular, reusable functions and components.
- Avoid large, monolithic files—prefer separation of concerns.

## 2. Version Control & Branching
- Use feature branches for new functionality (`feature/xyz`), bugfixes (`bugfix/abc`), and hotfixes (`hotfix/urgent`).
- Always branch from the latest main branch.
- Regularly pull updates from main to avoid merge conflicts.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages explaining the “why” behind each change.

## 3. Testing
- Write **unit tests** for all business logic and core functions.
- Write **integration tests** for API and data flow.
- Ensure >90% code coverage for critical modules.
- Run tests automatically via CI/CD pipeline before merging.

## 4. Documentation
- Keep README.md and feature docs up to date.
- Document new APIs, endpoints, and environment variables.
- Add JSDoc/type comments to exported functions and interfaces.
- Update guides and troubleshooting sections as new features/changes are made.

## 5. Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials—use environment variables.
- Sanitize all user input (prevent XSS, SQL injection, etc).
- Rotate API keys regularly.
- Only allow CORS from trusted domains.
- Transmit all data over HTTPS.

## 6. Error Handling & Fallbacks
- Implement robust error handling with clear user feedback.
- Use exponential backoff and retry logic for API calls.
- Provide fallback mock data for development and demo modes.
- Log errors without exposing sensitive information.

## 7. Performance Optimization
- Use parallel API calls and caching where possible.
- Lazy load non-critical components.
- Avoid blocking UI—use background processing for heavy tasks.
- Monitor and optimize API response times.

## 8. Accessibility & UX
- Ensure forms use proper validation and error messaging.
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
- Provide clear loading states and progress indicators.
- Make the UI responsive and mobile-friendly.

## 9. Collaboration & Reviews
- Use pull requests for all changes—require code review before merging.
- Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, features, and tasks.
- Tag PRs and issues with meaningful labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `security`).
- Encourage team communication and feedback on designs and architecture.

## 10. Continuous Improvement
- Regularly refactor code to improve readability and efficiency.
- Monitor performance, accuracy, and user feedback.
- Schedule periodic reviews for dependencies, security, and best practices.
- Stay updated with new technologies and industry standards.

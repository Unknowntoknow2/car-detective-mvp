## Issue 1: VIN Validation & Normalization (ISO 3779)

```markdown
## Summary
Implement strict VIN validator (regex + check digit) and canonicalization (trim+uppercase).

## Scope
- [ ] Add Postgres `fn_validate_vin(vin text)` and `fn_vin_check_digit(vin text)` (see SQL in artifacts)
- [ ] Enforce via `vehicle_specs.vin` CHECK constraint + API input validation  
- [ ] Return `400_INVALID_VIN`, `422_CHECK_DIGIT_FAIL` error codes
- [ ] Integrate with existing unified VIN decoder service

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Invalid VINs rejected at database and API level
- [ ] Unit tests include fuzz testing for edge cases
- [ ] Clear error UX messages shown to users
- [ ] Performance: validation <5ms per VIN
- [ ] Integration with existing `/src/services/unifiedVinDecoder.ts`

## Implementation Notes
- Use existing unified VIN decoder validation logic in `/src/services/vinValidation.ts`
- Integrate with current Supabase edge functions
- Update frontend error handling for new error codes
- SQL functions available in `/sql/vin_validation_functions.sql`

## Issue 3: Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection

```markdown
## Summary
Implement per-IP and per-user rate limits on decode/recall/safety endpoints with WAF rules.

## Scope
- [ ] Edge middleware with token bucket algorithm (`60/min/IP`, `300/day/user`)
- [ ] Return `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header
- [ ] IP blocklists + basic WAF patterns for common attacks
- [ ] Rate limit headers in all responses
- [ ] Admin override capability for testing/whitelisting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] k6 load tests demonstrate proper throttling behavior
- [ ] Logs include rate-limit counters and violations
- [ ] Graceful degradation under sustained load
- [ ] Admin interface for managing rate limits
- [ ] Monitoring alerts for abuse patterns

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate with Supabase edge function middleware
- Use Redis or similar for distributed rate limiting
- Consider user authentication tiers (free/paid)
- k6 test file available in `/k6/decode_vin.js`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Rate limiting active and enforced
- [ ] Load tests pass with proper throttling
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards showing rate limit metrics
- [ ] Documentation updated with rate limit information
```

## Issue 4: Caching & Performance Hardening

```markdown
## Summary
Implement namespaced cache with SWR, negative caching, request coalescing, and eviction.

## Scope
- [ ] Database table: `api_cache(key, payload, ttl_seconds, source, fetched_at)`
- [ ] Namespaced cache keys: `vpic:VIN:...`, `ncap:year:make:model`, `recalls:VIN`
- [ ] Stale-While-Revalidate: serve cached if < TTL; revalidate async
- [ ] Negative cache for invalid VINs (prevent repeated API calls)
- [ ] Request coalescing: per-VIN lock to prevent thundering herd
- [ ] Configurable timeouts: vPIC/NCAP/Recalls 2.5s with exponential backoff

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] p95 response time < 400ms on warm cache path
- [ ] Cache hit rate ‚â• 50% under normal load
- [ ] No thundering herd behavior on cache misses
- [ ] Graceful timeout and retry handling
- [ ] Cache eviction prevents unbounded growth

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate with existing unified VIN decoder
- Use Supabase for cache storage with RLS policies
- Consider Redis for high-performance caching layer
- Implement cache warming for popular VINs

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Cache behavior verified under load
- [ ] Monitoring shows cache hit rates
- [ ] Eviction policies working correctly
```

## Issue 5: Postgres Migrations, Constraints & RLS (Phase 1)

```markdown
## Summary
Finalize core database tables with constraints, RLS policies, and server-only write RPCs.

## Scope
- [ ] Unique constraints: `vehicle_specs.vin`, composite `nhtsa_recalls(vin,campaign_id)`
- [ ] NOT NULL constraints for critical fields
- [ ] RLS policies: `vehicle_specs` (anon read via view), `api_cache` server-only
- [ ] SECURITY DEFINER RPCs: `upsert_specs`, `upsert_recalls`, `upsert_safety`, `upsert_fuel`
- [ ] Rollback scripts for all migrations
- [ ] Seed test data for development/testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `supabase db push` succeeds without errors
- [ ] RLS policies verified - no unauthorized access possible
- [ ] Seed data loads successfully in clean database
- [ ] Rollback scripts tested and working
- [ ] Server-only write access enforced

## Implementation Notes

# VIN Decoder Abstraction (FAANG-Level)

## Overview
A production-grade, fully automated, compliant, and extensible VIN Decoder Abstraction for the AIN vehicle data enrichment pipeline. Aligns with Phases 1â€“5: compliance, acquisition, normalization, enrichment, monitoring, and valuation integration.

---

## Features
- Multi-provider support (NHTSA, commercial, partner APIs)
- Automated ToS/robots.txt compliance monitoring and alerting
- Modular provider connectors (plug-and-play)
- Canonical schema mapping and enrichment hooks (recall, geo, fuel, explainability)
- Provenance, compliance, and audit logging for every decode event
- Robust error handling, rate limiting, and fallback logic
- Real-time monitoring/alerting integration points
- Production-ready, extensible, and fully tested

---

## Usage
```python
from vin_decoder_abstraction import decode_and_map
vin = "4T1C11AK3PU162087"
result = decode_and_map(vin)
print(result)
```

---

## Extending Providers
- Add new provider classes inheriting from `VinDecodeProvider`
- Register in the provider list in `VinDecoder`
- Ensure ToS/robots.txt URLs are tracked in `provider_compliance_monitor.py`

---

## Compliance & Monitoring
- Run `provider_compliance_monitor.py` on schedule (Airflow/Temporal)
- Integrate alert output with Slack/email for compliance changes
- All decode events log provenance and compliance metadata

---

## Testing
- See `test_vin_decoder_abstraction.py` for unit tests
- Add integration tests for new providers and enrichment hooks

---

## Auditing & Transparency
- All decode results include provenance, provider, and enrichment fields
- SHAP/explainability hooks ready for valuation transparency

---

## Onboarding & Ops
- See this README and code docstrings for onboarding
- All modules are modular, testable, and ready for continuous deployment

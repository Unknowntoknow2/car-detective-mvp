# TypeScript and Build Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. GitHub Workflow YAML Syntax Errors
- Fixed `if` condition syntax in CI/CD workflows
- Removed incorrect `${{ }}` wrapper around secrets context checks
- Updated: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

### 2. Missing Dependencies
- Added `lucide-react@^0.263.1` to package.json
- Installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve React version conflicts
- The project uses React 19 but lucide-react expects React 16-18

### 3. Deno Edge Functions TypeScript Issues
- Created `supabase/functions/tsconfig.json` for Deno edge functions
- Created `supabase/functions/deno-types.d.ts` with proper Deno global types
- This resolves "Cannot find name 'Deno'" errors in edge functions

### 4. Enhanced UI Type Issues
- Fixed duplicate imports and exports in `src/components/enhanced-ui/index.ts`
- Added `WaterfallDataPoint` interface to fix adjuster panel waterfall data typing
- Fixed import paths in `EnhancedUIDashboard.tsx` to include `panels/` directory
- Added missing type definitions locally to dashboard component

### 5. Test File Structure Issues
- Fixed duplicate imports and describe blocks in `tests/consolidation.test.ts`
- Removed redundant code that was causing syntax errors

## Commands to Run

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Verify TypeScript Compilation
```bash
# Check main project
npx tsc --noEmit --project .

# Check Deno edge functions separately
cd supabase/functions && deno check **/*.ts
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Build Project
```bash
npm run build
```

## Remaining Minor Issues

1. **React Version Compatibility**: lucide-react expects React 16-18 but we're using React 19. This is resolved with `--legacy-peer-deps` but may cause minor runtime issues.

2. **Some Supabase Function Type Issues**: A few edge functions still have minor type issues that don't affect functionality but show as warnings.

3. **DataCollectionForm Type Mismatch**: One component has a parameter type mismatch that needs business logic review.

## Architecture Notes

This is a hybrid project with:
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend Edge Functions**: Deno + TypeScript + Supabase
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Supabase
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Python and Node.js testing

The project successfully combines Node.js tooling for the frontend with Deno runtime for serverless functions, which required separate TypeScript configurations.
